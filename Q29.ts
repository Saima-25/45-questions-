/* Favorite Fruit: Make an array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent 
if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
 • Make an array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.

 • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. 
If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!*/
